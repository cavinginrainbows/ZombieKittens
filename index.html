				<h1>Zombie kittens and other evil spores with surrealist animator Cyriak</h1>
				<p>
					The work and toils of Cyriak Harris range from the creation of animations, music, and struggles of plagiarism. 
					He provides his community with entertaining works of art that sink deeply into surrealist inspirations and 
					carry with them a tang of disorientation and the bizarre. 
				</p>

						I started making weird animated gifs in 2004, and even weirder animated videos in 2006, and have been spreading my evil spores across the internet ever since. 
						My commercial work spans such diverse realms as advertising, television and music videos. The software I use is Adobe After Effects for animation, 
						and FL Studio for making music.
					</p>
					<p>
						I lived in Brighton for about ten years, and moved somewhere else several years ago. Everyone still thinks I live in Brighton, and I have lost the strength of 
						will to keep correcting them. I currently live in a crumbling house in the middle of nowhere, which is kept standing by the efforts of its many resident spiders.

				<h2>Style</h2>
				<p>
					Cyriak is a big fan of other surrealist animations and animators. In an interview with Skwigly in 2011 he credited many artists as inspiration with his work:
				</p>
				<blockquote cite="https://www.skwigly.co.uk/cyriak-harris-interview/">
					<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i>
					<p>
						I’m a fan of surreal art and comedy – there are obvious parallels with Monty Python in my videos, but I also take inspiration from artists like Jan Svankmajer, 
						M C Escher, H R Giger and of course Dali. 
						Anything that is slightly disturbing in its subversion of reality.
						<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					He also explained that while he was not sure why he created such bizarre artworks, the influence may be from old TV cartoons which “could be quite disturbing,” 
					and felt the need to “continue the tradition.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Cyriak’s art style is considered surrealism, which suggests that human experiences and streams of consciousness are reality. Creating art that aims to capture that experience.

				<h2>MEOW</h2>
				<p>
					MEOW has been Cyriak’s favorite work, and he states that he greatly enjoyed working on it with his friend, illustrator Sarah Brown.

				<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
				<figure>

				<p>
					In 2016, Cyriak accused McDonald’s of plagiarizing his Cows Cows & Cows video in their advertisement. The spokesperson from DPZ&T, 
					the advertising agency who made the video, denied the claim and only admitted to using “references” in their work. 
					Nonetheless the ad was pulled after Cyriak’s tweets about the theft went viral. This was not the first time McDonald’s had been guilty of “borrowing” from Cyriak’s work: 
					a Swedish McDonald’s ad from a few years prior also resembled one of the artist’s gifs a little too closely to just be considered inspiration.

							'In general they get away with it because it is expensive and stressful to fight back, and because they are re-creating the visuals it is often no more than a similarity, 
							even if it is blatantly referencing the original,' Cyriak told Buzzfeed. 

							The frustrating thing is that in an ideal world artists and advertisers form a symbiotic relationship where each helps the other.
